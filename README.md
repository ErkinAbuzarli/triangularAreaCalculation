# triangularAreaCalculation
A start point to calculate n edged geometric shape by dividing it to triangels.



# Example of Program

Enter how many sides of shape: 4
Enter the coordinates:
0,0
Enter the coordinates:
0,2
Enter the coordinates:
2,2
Enter the coordinates:
2,0

Perimetr: 8.00
Area: 4.00

The 1 . angle is 90.00
The 2 . angle is 90.00
The 3 . angle is 90.00
The 4 . angle is 90.00


Shape like that:
